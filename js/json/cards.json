These markets offered townspeople a chance to stock up on food and supplies to tide them over in the cold months. These small traders, mostly farmers, ensured townspeople with steady supply of goods, even in the most difficult times. With time, craftspeople began setting up stands at winter markets to sell baskets, toys and woodcarvings. There were also booths for almonds, nuts, roasted chestnuts, gingerbread and other baked goods. Still today, Christmas markets combine the festive atmosphere of heavenly choirs and succulent foods with gift shopping for such items as toys and other presents for children, crafts and gift items.

Christmas trees displayed publicly and illuminated with electric lights became popular in the early 20th century. Christmas lights were too expensive for the average person; as such, electric Christmas lights did not become the majority replacement for candles until 1930. In the United States, it became popular to outline private homes with such Christmas lights in tract housing beginning in the 1960s. By the late 20th century, the custom had also been adopted in non-western countries, notably in Japan and Hong Kong.",

However, it is true that Coca‑Cola advertising played a big role in shaping the jolly, rotund character we know and love today. In 1931, Coca‑Cola commissioned Swedish-American artist Haddon Sundblom to paint Santa Claus for the company's Christmas adverts. Prior to this, Santa had been portrayed in a variety of ways throughout history: tall and gaunt; short and elfin; distinguished and intellectual; even downright frightening. Sundblom’s paintings for Coca‑Cola established Santa as a warm, happy character with human features such as rosy cheeks, a white beard, twinkling eyes and laughter lines. This grandfather-style Coca‑Cola Santa captivated the public and, as our adverts spread globally, the perception of the North Pole’s most-famous resident changed forever.",

They became more and more popular and he started his own business called Bob's Candies.
